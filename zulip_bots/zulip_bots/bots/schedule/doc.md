Schedule Bot

Ideas:
1. Ping the bot to get a list of your events for the day (or rest of the day)
2. Have the bot send morning schedules out to people if they've signed up
3. Habe the bot ping you when certain events (or all events) that you've signed up for are starting.
4. Should this be an extension of RSVP bot?

Questions:
1. How to hook up to the RC calendar
2. How to relate the person pinging the bot to a person in the list of event participants. 
    - Do I need to do some sort of authentication and then store that knowledge?
    - Are Rc'ers zulip accounts attached to their account in RC?
